# Reinforcement learning

## 1. Giới thiệu chung về Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is learning what to do—how to map situations to actions—so
as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which actions to
take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. In
the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may a↵ect not only the immediate
reward but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards. These two
characteristics—trial-and-error search and delayed reward—are the two most important
distinguishing features of reinforcement learning.
